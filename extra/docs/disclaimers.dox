 * @warning CLib2 is NOT thread-safe by default.
 * Assume that CLib2 is not thread-safe unless explicitly stated otherwise.
 * You can safely assume that a module is reentrant (no global or static local state)
 * but not thread-safe (synchronization is handled by the caller) unless explicitly stated
 * otherwise.
